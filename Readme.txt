Hello team!

We’ve discussed a lot on whatsapp group and created so much together already. Now it’s time to make things official. As our professor mentioned, we should start using the Canvas discussion board , especially here GitHub for committing, pushing, and pulling our work.

Let’s get everything organised and move our work to the official platforms. We’ve got this! 💪😊

""""""""""""""""""""RULES for this DOC""""""""""""
1)KEEP THIS DOCUMENT INTACTED - (do not remove any text so that we can know, who done what and when)
2)ADD DATE ( it is not imp for everyone to record, VCS does that but for visual purpose it is good)

we have a week and im sure we can workaround to get the work done on time, all we need is just spend 4 to 6 hours per day so to complete this project ASAP, and i believe we can do it easily if we collaborate as we already done "descriptive statistic" project individually successfully

			-----GITHUB RULES
All members should contribute by rotating roles DAILY.
 Team Git flow :
 Branch → Edit → Add → Commit → Pull → Push → PR
 Rules: Don’t push to main → Write clear commit messages → Don’t upload big files → Fix conflicts.

@Prof recommned us to follow some rules and that are as follows

git pull                 # Get newest team updates
git status               # See what changed
git add .                # Stage everything
git commit -m "message"  # Save snapshot
git push                 # Upload to remote repo
.........................
		Do And Don'ts with Git

Don’t start working without pulling first.
Don’t commit without staging the right files.
Don’t write unclear commit messages.
Don’t work directly on the main branch.
Don’t make one huge commit at the end.
Don’t keep your work only locally.
Don’t create a messy folder structure.
