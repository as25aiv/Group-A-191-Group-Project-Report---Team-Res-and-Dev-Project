Hello team!

We’ve discussed a lot on whatsapp group and created so much together already. Now it’s time to make things official. As our professor mentioned, we should start using the Canvas discussion board , especially here GitHub for committing, pushing, and pulling our work.

Let’s get everything organised and move our work to the official platforms. We’ve got this! 💪😊
