Hello team!

We’ve discussed a lot on whatsapp group and created so much together already. Now it’s time to make things official. As our professor mentioned, we should start using the Canvas discussion board , especially here GitHub for committing, pushing, and pulling our work.

Let’s get everything organised and move our work to the official platforms. We’ve got this! 💪😊

""""""""""""""""""""RULES for this DOC""""""""""""
1)KEEP THIS DOCUMENT INTACTED - (do not remove any text so that we can know, who done what and when)
2)ADD DATE-TIME ( it is not imp for everyone to record, VCS does that but for visual purpose it is good)

we have a week and im sure we can workaround to get the work done on time, all we need is just spend 4 to 6 hours per day so to complete this project ASAP, and i believe we can do it easily if we collaborate as we already done "descriptive statistic" project individually successfully
